# Fantasy Icons v1.0
## What is Fantasy Icons?
Fantasy Icons is a collection of fantasy inspired open source icons (lord of the rings, dungeons & dragons, game of thrones, etc). Each icon is designed on a x grid.
## Usage
At the moment fantasy-icons is a collection of SVG files. This means that you can use fantasy icons in all the same ways you can use SVGs (e.g. `img`, `background-image`, `inline`, `object`, `embed`, `iframe`). Here's a helpful article detailing the many ways SVGs can be used on the web: [SVG on the Web – Implementation Options](https://svgontheweb.com/#implementation)
